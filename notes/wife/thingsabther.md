Babe omg im sooo sorry that you have to go through that If I could hold you right now, I would, and I wouldn’t let go. I’d let you cry, I’d listen to every word, every silence, every shake in your voice. You’ve been through so much, and it breaks my heart knowing how alone you’ve felt. But you’re not alone now. I’m here, and I love you more than words will ever be able to say. You’re not broken, babyyou’re just hurting, and I wish I could take every bit of that pain away. I see the real you the soft, kind, beautiful soul underneath it all. And no matter what your family tries to take from you, I’ll keep loving you, over and over again, in every life idk how to write and how to comfort that much ml im so sorry
