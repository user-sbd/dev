I have read your message so many times, and every time it fills me with emotions I can’t quite put into words. You say words feel small, but yours didn’t they felt like home, like comfort, like love in its purest form. You see me in a way no one else does, and the way you love me it’s healing parts of me I didn’t even know were broken. You talk about how I saved you, but the truth is, you saved me too. You brought light into my life, gave me hope, made me believe in a future that actually feels worth dreaming about. I want everything with you the quiet nights, the chaos, the family, the forever. You’re not just my love, you’re my safe place, my strength, my whole heart. I feel so lucky to be yours, and I promise I’ll never take this love for granted Thank you for loving me like you do I love you more than you’ll ever know, with everything I am I love you sm you have no idea how much you have also healed me sm ml
