yuvani im so sorry for not giving you the full explanation you deserved when i moved from my moms house to my dads i know i only notified you quickly and that wasnt fair to you it was a sudden decision driven by safety concerns and in that moment i was focused on making sure i was okay so that we could continue to build our future together i never meant to leave you feeling out of the loop or hurt it breaks my heart to think i might have caused you any worry you mean the world to me and i promise to communicate better because you deserve my honesty and my heart in every moment
you make me the happiest person alive yuvani every morning youre the first thought in my mind and every night youre the last before i close my eyes sending you good morning and good night texts is my favorite ritual because i know they make you smile and your smile fills my heart in a way i cant even describe your voice so soft and perfect feels like a melody that calms my soul and every time we talk i feel like im floating your laugh when i compliment you its like music that brings out the kid in me jumping with joy like im a little boy again
