The loss of life is not okay, following this point all the students have been requesting for a sit in solidarity;To show how this situation is not right in any manner no matter the reasons, to respect the losses of many innocent lives and grieving of their families. These seam as the appropriate measures of the utmost concerning situation at hand. The loss of life is not okay and the requests have been ongoing from many members of this school. To show our respect, I believe this would be appropriate in the given situation. This message is on the behalf of the students.
