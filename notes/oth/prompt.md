Using the nano-banana model, take the provided reference image of the 1/7 scale commercialized figurine and generate a new version in a realistic photographic style, maintaining exact proportions, pose, clothing, and details of the figurine which will be provided in the image . Keep the figurine identical, including its round transparent acrylic base with no text. Place it on a wooden computer desk in a dimly lit indoor studio setup with soft warm lighting from a nearby desk lamp and subtle blue LED glows illuminating the background walls and shelves for a aesthetic vibe. Replace the generic keyboard with a detailed mechanical keyboard featuring blue backlit LEDs on the keys and edges. Ensure proper proportions across the entire scene: the monitor is a large curved screen showing the exact wireframe 3D brush modeling process of this figurine in progress; next to it is the unopened BANDAI-style toy packaging box with vibrant two-dimensional flat illustrations of the character on the front and sides, standing upright. Add a small glass ashtray on the desk edge containing a lit blunt with visible smoke curling up subtly. Include scattered desk accessories like a mouse, cables, and papers for realism, but keep the focus on the figurine, screen, and box. Render the PVC material of the figurine with glossy, high-fidelity textures, subtle reflections, and lifelike sheen under the lighting. High-resolution, photorealistic, no distortions.
