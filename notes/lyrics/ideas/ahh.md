she know that im getting lit in the hills i pay the bills
crusin in a bentayga she know that i be on drills
drove thru the graveyard half of dem was the mandems kills
mandems kills u know that we rlly spill
when u see a nigga gushin thats the biggest thrill

the block still talks to me it say im a monster
im a ghost on the corner and a dead man's sponsor
watched my brothers bleed out on the sidewalk
saw the devil smile when i gave him the rock
sold my soul for a hunnid thousand a pop
gone off the lean cant even stand up straight
searchin for my love but its gettin real late
my mama she hates me she say im a lost case
she said im a stain on the family's good grace

aint got no feelins i just feel the drugs
i got no friends just a bunch of thugs
aint got no love just a bunch of fake hugs
they said they loved me but they was just killin my buzz
my heart is a tomb for all the people i lost
the price of this life got a heavy cost
im a machine now i just move and i don't stop
im a product of the streets the way i drop

but she different she not like the rest
she sees the pain i hide under my chest
she sees the scars i got and all my mess
shes the only one that makes me feel blessed
told me its okay to feel sad and to cry
said the drugs aint a way to get by
told me we can leave this whole life and fly
she told me that she loves me and she aint gonna lie
shes the only reason that i feel like i can win
the only one that makes me wanna live again
shes the only one that can wash away my sins
the only one that i wanna let in

so we ridin to the hills leavin the block
ditchin the graves and we leavin the glock
leavin the pain and we leavin the clock
goin somewhere new we bout to change the whole plot
my benz she cruisin we goin real fast
got real love now we know its gonna last
leavin the graveyard and we leavin the past
found a new life and we found it at last
