100 on da dash 
crusin ina scat
smokin on dis extra extra loud pack

broken loyalty, (they don’t ride for me),
fake love’s a drug, (it just lies to me),

bitches said they love me who are you to i
who am i to you pushin thru the whip this ain nun new

no ID in the club dey know we the ones
CID in the crib taking all the fundz
they know we the ones who stack smoking on dem runtz
