codeine in my system hitech in my mouth  
bro give me some wisdom better make it out
wockhardt dreams purple haze had me floatin through the drought  
mama wasnt home pops a ghost pacin round da house  

karmas got a grudge every sin in vain
tried to drowm em out but they swim in the pain 
switched it up turn that pain into gain
ever since that day i cant feel the same
my biggest shame now my rise to fame

seventeen im sippin lean tryna blur the shit i seen
broken mirrors in my mind seven years of shattered dreams
she slide da bean it cost a lotta green
on yo block w a strap all u do is scream

every pill a bad decision every sip a bad religion 
ina good condition same me new edition
quit da lean tradition in da right position
shootin w precision hope she see the vision
shawty got me trippin high off my ambition
loves like a drug this ma new addiction

demons whisper shadows slink pour more purple watch me sink
karmas cold it bites it stings debts i owe done broke ma wings
pills dissolve my pain be vast dreams turn to completed tasks
these pills a mask for the pain i pray i find my home
fuck the world im on my own heart colder than this chrome  
used to call these streets my home but they carved me to the bone  

tinted dreams im cruisin slow where the fuck im posed to go  
fake love gone da truth show karmas callin debts i owe  
codeine waves im sinkin low but she pulled me from the glow

i was lost in the dark no spark no light  
drownin in the syrup no heart no fight  
she came through with real love shit dont lie  
healed my wounds now im showin her to the sky  

mama said id be nothin just a shadow of her fears
pops was out here chasin checks left me in tears
hearing all the things that i never wanna hear

grew up in the place where the love was counterfeit  
friends turned to foes switchin up like a switch  
hitech in my cup had me movin like a ghost  
wockhardt in my veins yeah i do the fuckin most  
do the fuckin most cro ill kick u out yo post
percs had me slippin thought id never see the coast  
karmas like a boomerang its circlin back with precision  
every lie i told myself reflected in my vision  

tinted benz im ridin low city lights like broken vows  
thought id die before i changed but im still here somehow  
met her in the chaos eyes like stars in midnight rain  
she saw through my armor held my soul through all the pain  
no more sippin on that purple no more poppin them pills  
shes my anchor in the storm keepin me from them chills  

i was lost in the dark no spark no light  
drownin in the syrup no heart no fight  
she came through with love real shit no lie  
healed my wounds now im touchin the sky  

used to wake up to the shakes body screamin for a hit  
codeine like a siren had me aching for sip 
parents left me in the cold no hand to grip  
learned to hustle through the struggle turned my pain in to a script  

citys still the same but im seein it thru a different lens  
tinted dreams turned vivid now im writin my amends  
every bars a piece of me every rhymes a mend  

tinted dreams im cruisin slow where the fuck im posed to go  
fake love gone da truth show karmas callin debts i owe  
codeine waves im sinkin low but she pulled me from the glow
