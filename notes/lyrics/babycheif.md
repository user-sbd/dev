she know that im getting lit in the hills i pay the bills
crusin in a bentayga she know that i be on drills
drove thru the graveyard half of dem was the mandems kills
mandems kills u know that we rlly spill
when u see a nigga gushin thats the biggest thrill

i be goin dummy on the perc
she be sendin pictures in a skirt
she know i be makin that money work
got a hunnid thousand on the shirt
said she love me but i know it hurt
she said i be toxic i dont flirt
real love i dont feel it on the turf
thats why i be leanin like the purge
sippin wok and smokin on the herb
i cant hear a word of what they say
i be movin paranoid all day
but with her i really wanna stay
cuz she different she dont want no fame
she just want my love to feel the rain
wanna put a ring on it thats the aim
she dont see me for the whips and chain
she just see a nigga with the pain
she wanna talk to me about my past
she know i been livin way too fast
tryna make this feeling really last
all the other bitches in the trash
they was only with me for the cash
but this girl she really on my ass
in a good way she make me feel good
she remind me i got understood
she the only one that really could
get me out the trenches out the hood
i know we aint livin like we should
but with her i know we really could
we can run away from all this mess
we can leave it all and feel the best
i aint wanna put her to the test
i aint wanna cause her no more stress
she the only one i can impress
i ain't wanna be with no one less
she the only one that ease my mind
she the only one i wanna find
in this world where all these feelings blind
i dont wanna leave her left behind
we can hit the hills and leave it all
she can be my love my baby doll
when i fall i know she catch me tall
when i call she answer every call
i done seen it all i done been through hell
i done seen some demons i could tell
but with her i know we doin well
she the only one that hold the cell
my baby my real my only one
we can have a family have a son
we can leave this life like it was done
we can live it all out in the sun
she the only one that i would run
she the only one that got my gun
