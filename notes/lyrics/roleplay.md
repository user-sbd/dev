# * pass dat blunt cronem *

sippin on dis extra lean i need more promethizine
hop outta the whip bro its a fucking smoke scream
super high in the moutains cro im, uk im rlly sightseein
u know that ur man got green
blood on all my shirt, tis bih need a dry clean
she wanna get w me, this ho extra keen
put her inna whip 5 days she starting poppin beans
i still tell my mama that im clean

how to feel when u see the shit i seen
my first body i saw i was only fourteen
seen both sides and everything like everything betwenn
stayin up late nights off that cafiene 
i kept the same letter but now its the codiene
heart cold matches w the cold lean

dirty cup pour it up sip more sprite you know im up

blood or what in my cup u know ima vampire
sip it up she know dat my lyrics rlly on fire
pops called me i thought he was buyer
real niggas started wearing dem fake wires
spark it up w a torch dis bih a campfire
see my song young niggas say i inspire
showed real love that shit always backfire
at the funeral crying listening to the choir
street life a game no fucking umpire
my loyalty sumn thhat will never expire
late nights gunfire had to keep it up cuz u know im the supplier
