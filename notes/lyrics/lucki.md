they say its all love right

hundred on the dash crusin in a scat pack
smokin on this loud pack its a fact
broken loyalty they dont ride for me where the love at
fake loves a drug and it just lies to me what is trust at
cid in the crib takin all the funds thats a setup
one day out randoms asking me for shit like let me getupp
seen his body drop fo some street rep what a letdown
when you take a life nigga aint no refund dats a mandown
mandown my face don een got a frown ion feel like shit no more
try to take when wen we in the town nigga we gon up the score

demons in my mind got me talkin to the walls
ion know if ima stand up or ima fall
voices in the back of my head they keep callin out for more
poppin percs just to silence all the noise behind the door
sippin lean tryna wash away the pain down to the core
they see the chains they see the whips they think a nigga made it
but they dont see the empty crib the family that hate it
mama on that other shit her own son she cant face it
another headline another black face they just racist

they see the money the cars the clothes they think im livin large
but look closer at the pain see all the mental scars
they see the smoke they see the drink they see me goin hard
but they dont see the broken soul splittin apart
is it worth it all this cash but the love is absent
hearts turn to plastic the world feels so massive
just tryna find a moment that feels real
yeah searchin for a truth that ain just feels

she said they love me who are you to i
who am i to you just a dollar sign in they eye
pushin thru the whip this aint nothin new i just ride
another friend lost to the violence i just cry inside
got me boxed in cant they see in no more 
just another number headed for the morgue or the pen door
hate the way they judge me soon as i step in the store
karmas watchin everything keepin the score
im haunted by the memories the laughter the smiles
now im pourin out the syrup walkin down these dark aisles
poppin pills to escape the truth for a little while
drownin in the luxury drownin in the style
they know we the ones who stack smokin on them runtz
they know we the ones who came from nothin frontin bout the stunts
this life of sin i wonder if its ever gonna blunt
the constant ache the feelin that youre always up against

they see the money the cars the clothes they think im livin large
but look closer at the pain see the mental scars
they see the smoke they see the drink they see me goin hard
but they dont see the broken soul splittin apart
is it worth it all this cash but the love is absent
hearts turn to plastic the world feels so massive
just tryna find a moment that feels authentic
yeah searchin for a truth that aint materialistic

then i come home to you the silence aint so loud
you wipe the ash away and you calm the crowd
the voices in my head you makin them shroud
you lift me off the ground when im in a cloud
you see the man behind the money and the misery
you dont judge my past you just build a new history
your touch is the only thing that feels like clarity
youre the only real thing in this world of parity

hundred on the dash but the destinations unclear
crusin in the scat just runnin from the fear
smokin on that pack til the memories disappear
gonna make it through another one of these long years
maybe
voices fade
