Write a pdf document as a formal letter to the managing director MD of fishtail academy from me: Nitin, a student of grade 10 who has a lot to say about this school. 

first off the teachers are doing the opposite of motivating the students im not just saying me but everyone in my class has been getting demotivated by the teachers and ontop of that the IB WORLD SCHOOL rules state that you arent allowed to beat students yet im sure there hasnt been a day where i havent seen someone get beaten and ontop of that the teachers instead of trying to understand whats going on they always rush to conclusions and listen to whoever spekas first in the class and the physical and emoitonal harassment is getting out of hand

also include many studies where it shows that their is no relation between hair and studies and if u can find any ruels in govermnet of nepal that says students shouldnt get beaten and also they dont HAVE to cut their hair if they dont want too if its not directly affecting studies and also include studies of the related things and make it a typst document even all the studies and include a AAA citation at the bottom with all of the required sources and make it using profeshinal language but be passive agressive towards the teachers not that badly and provide examples such as sirs grabbing students hair and even in the morning yesterday they had taken a glue stick with the intention of beating students and used it in the morning classes and teachers will demotivate students to the point of almost crying which ive seen myself and i can confirm with the student and also say how im not just saying this from my part this is how our whole class feels but im standing up because i cant handle this anymore (that doesnt mean that the students cant do it im just worried) also include diagrams as im a student from canada and include the change in behavior when teachers are nicer with studies and other things that are far more improved when the school that preaches being "international" but in reality its very far from that. include all the required citeations and quote directly from studies and the rules of goverment of nepal and ib world school rules and make sure its convincing and make it fairly long maybe a couple pages make it all in a typst document aswell once again and make it using a profeshinal font jet brains mono in font size 13 and in a formal letter but very long format thank you
