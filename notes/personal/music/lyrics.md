Starting verse

    pain in my chest, i don’t feel the same,  
    two-three shots, left his soul stained
    claim you a pimp, but your bitch been tamed,  
    rose from the hood, carried scars and shame.  
    up on your block with my drako gripped,  
    hundred rounds , yeah, the mag don’t quit,  
    she’s throwin’ it back,she pu to the crib,  
    caught you outside, now your crew’s prayin’ quick,  
    i fought for my spot, built up brick by brick.  
    all black fit, ski mask on tight
    you aint re tough, you’re dodgin’ gun fights,  
    feds know the truth, i been slangin’ that pipe,  
    barrel been spittin’ and the works packed tight
    my own cro turned, left me lone all night.  
    talking about me see a flash then u up
    no family love, i know who to trust
    blood in my veins, but they treat me like its dust,  
    now i’m stackin’ my chips, show the opps whos up,  
    they laughed at my dreams, said i’d never break free,  
    no hand from my folks, just kept it g,  
    if you want the smoke i got a g 23
    put it to yo head now you deceased
    i’m loud with my truth, let the struggle run deep.  
    betrayed by my own, left me out in the rain,  
    carried my weight through the losses and pain,  
    now i’m risin’ like smoke, breakin’ free from the chain,  
    every bar that i spit’s like a spark to the flame,  
    my rise is my story they screamin my name.
    up on yo block i might needa snatch a chain
    say u beefing me uon wanna play dis game
    keep the draco w me i got good aim
    i got this shit like what 200k for a chain
    i keep on feeling like all my energys being drained
