Windows Tinted Black

Racin’ in a scat pack, tell her don’t look back,  
Can’t see through, ‘cause the windows tinted black, black.  
Ion know why I’m feelin’ shit, I’m off the aak,  
Shorted me like 20 bands, you ain’t gettin’ no slack.  

Came up from the bottom, now I’m flexin’ on these racks,  
Fake friends in the shadows, I’m cuttin’ all the cracks.  
Lost myself in the chaos, but I’m findin’ my path,  
Got my girl right beside me, we just laughin’ at the past.  

Chorus:  
Windows tinted black, we ride, we slide,  
Ain’t no love from my fam, just the grind and the pride.  
With the best girl in the world, yeah, she makes me feel alive,  
Even when I fuck up, she’s the reason that I thrive.  

Rollin’ through the streets, we poppin’ bottles, no caps,  
Ballin’ like we’re Kobe, makin’ moves, no collapse.  
Thuggin’ with my crew, real ones on the map,  
Know who to trust, ain’t no time for a trap.  

Got that loud pack burnin’, I’m lost in the smoke,  
Feelin’ high off this life, my heart’s never broke.  
Bitches playin’ games, but they can’t even cope,  
I’m rockin’ with my queen, she’s my anchor, my hope.  

Chorus:  
Windows tinted black, we ride, we slide,  
Ain’t no love from my fam, just the grind and the pride.  
With the best girl in the world, yeah, she makes me feel alive,  
Even when I fuck up, she’s the reason that I thrive.  

In the city of the drill, I’m the king of the block,   
Flexin’ on these haters, give a fuck if they mock.  
Turnin’ pain into power, yeah, I’m breakin’ the clock,  
Time to rise from the ashes, like a phoenix, I rock.  

Lost myself in the struggle, but I found my way back,  
With my girl by my side, I can’t ever fall slack.  
Windows tinted black, yeah, we ready to attack,  
Feelin’ high off this love, and that’s a straight fact.  

Chorus:  
Windows tinted black, we ride, we slide,  
Ain’t no love from my fam, just the grind and the pride.  
With the best girl in the world, yeah, she makes me feel alive,  
Even when I fuck up, she’s the reason that I thrive.  

Yeah, I made it from the bottom, now I’m sittin’ on stacks,  
Keep it real, keep it true, and I watch my back,  
Window’s tinted black, but the vision’s so clear,  
With my ride-or-die, it’s the thrill we hold dear.
