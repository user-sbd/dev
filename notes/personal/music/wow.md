*verse 1*  
ridin in this tinted whip windows blacker than my doubts  
codeine in my system hitech in my mouth  
she give me some wisdom better make it out

wockhardt dreams purple haze had me floatin through the drought  
mama wasnt home pops a ghost pacin in da house  

percs had me numb but the hurt still cut like a blade  
karmas got a grudge every sin been paid 
tried to drown my demons now they swim in pain  

seventeen im sippin lean tryna blur the shit i seen
broken mirrors in my mind seven years of shattered dreams
codeine drip, my soul’s been clipped, in da haze, my heart’s been gripped
demons whisper, shadows slink, pour more purple, watch me sink
karmas cold, it bites, it stings, debts i owe done broke ma wings
tinted glass, my pain’s a mask, lost at nights, no light to grasp
pills dissolve, my pain be vast, dreams turn to completed tasks

fuck the world im on my own heart colder than this chrome  
used to call these streets my home but they carved me to the bone  
every pill a bad decision every sip a bad religion  
prayed for peace i got my vision  

*hook*  
tinted dreams im cruisin slow where the fuck im posed to go  
fake love gone da truth show karmas callin debts i owe  
codeine waves im sinkin low but she pulled me from the glow  
now im risin she help me grow i love u i hope u know 

*chorus*  
i was lost in the dark no spark no light  
drownin in the syrup no heart no fight  
she came through with real love shit dont lie  
healed my wounds now im showin her to the sky  
grew away from the pain now im touchin the sky  

*verse 2*  
mama said id be nothin just a shadow of her fears
pops was out here chasin checks left me drownin in my tear
grew up in the place where the love was counterfeit  
friends turned to foes switchin up like a switch  
hitech in my cup had me movin like a ghost  
wockhardt in my veins yeah i did the fuckin most  
percs had me slippin thought id never see the coast  
addiction held me hostage but i broke free from the ropes  
karmas like a boomerang its circlin back with precision  
every lie i told myself reflected in my vision  
tinted benz im ridin low city lights like broken vows  
thought id die before i changed but im still here somehow  
met her in the chaos eyes like stars in midnight rain  
she saw through my armor held my soul through all the pain  
no more sippin on that purple no more poppin them pills  
shes my anchor in the storm keepin me from them chills  

*hook*  
tinted dreams im cruisin slow where the fuck im sposed to go  
fake love gone da truth show karmas callin debts i owe  
codeine waves im sinkin low but she pulled me from the glow  
now im risin she helping me grow  

*chorus*  
i was lost in the dark no spark no light  
drownin in the syrup no heart no fight  
she came through with love real shit no lie  
healed my wounds now im touchin the sky  
rised from the ashes now im touchin the sky  

*verse 3*  
used to wake up to the shakes body screamin for a hit  
codeine callin like a siren had me stuck in a pit  
parents left me in the cold no advice no hand to grip  
learned to hustle through the struggle turned my pain in to a script  
karmas got a long arm its collectin what i spent  
every high i chased was just a loan with heavy rent  
tinted windows hide the scars but the mirror dont pretend  
saw my demons in the glass had to face em in the end  
shes my light in the fog my compass in the maze  
her loves a sermon in the storm pullin me through the haze  
quit the lean dropped the percs left the wock in the past  
now im buildin somethin real foundations meant to last  
citys still the same but im seein it thru a different lens  
tinted dreams turned vivid now im writin my amends  
every bars a piece of me every rhymes a step to mend  
with her by my side i found the strength to start again  

*hook*  
tinted dreams im cruisin slow where the fuck im sposed to go  
fake love gone da truth show karmas callin debts i owe  
codeine waves im sinkin low but she pulled me from the glow  
now im risin she helping me grow  

*chorus*  
i was lost in the dark no spark no light  
drownin in the syrup no heart no fight  
she came through with love real shit no lie  
healed my wounds now im touchin the sky  
rised from the ashes now im touchin the sky  

*outro*  
tinted whip im rollin clean left the purple in the past  
her loves the fuel that keeps me movin fillin up my tank at last  
karmas paid my slate is clean im writin bars to break the cast  
from the ashes to the stars yeah my storys built to last
