  she said she love me, im drinkin third degree \  
  tryna deal with the pain but all she do is flee \  
  in the end, bae, its just you or me \  
  out in miami crusin ona jet ski \
  in this world turns out nun is free \
  tryna make it out giving god my plea \

  treat her like a princess in and out of fast cars \  
  i be outside drinkin, in and outa boujee bars \  
  i sip on the tec, my bih say au revoir \  
  you the one, baby girl, we can make it real far \  
  im like a dark night, baby, you my only star \  
  if its with you, bae, ill go to mars \  
  look on my wrist, girl, this aint just an audemar \  
  feel attraction, feel like drawn apart \  

  mix the tec with the wok, im floatin in my zone \  
  life hits different when u came from the stones \
  tryna chase a dream, but im stuck in monotone \  
  family say they love me, im out here on my own \  
  mama prayin for me, but dont pick up the phone \  
  pops aint checkin in, guess im better off alone \  
  looking for da opps so high im like a drone \
  i know they love, but its not shown \  
  heart cold like the lean in my cup, it’s overflown \  

  i’m dodgin demons daily, tryna keep my head straight \  
  pour another four, let it burn the pain away \  
  streets taught me lessons, but the price was too great \  
  lost some day ones, now my circle featherweight \  
  mix the purple drank, tryna find my escape \  
  but the high don’t last, life hits me in the face \  
  every night im faded, tryna dodge my own fate \  
  prayin to the stars, but they stuck behind the haze \  

  life a gamble, roll the dice, i got dirty hands \  
  tryna stack these racks, but the struggle got demands \  
  just left the club got like 50 rubber bands \
  tryna shine for my people, but they don’t understand \  

  i’m dodgin fake love, keep my heart in a vault \  
  see the drip, but not the tears that i fought \  
  every sip i take, it’s like ertyhing my fault\  
  but i keep it pushin, ‘cause this life ain’t my fault \  

  i’m ridin solo, with my thoughts in the whip \  
  windows tinted black, so they can’t see what i sip\  
  mix the wok with the sprite, take sum, let it hit \  
  tryna numb the pain, but it’s clingin like a bad bih\  
  i know they love me, but that love feel like a myth \  
  family turn they back, now i’m stuck in this rift \  
  still i chase the bag, tryna give my life a lift \  
  but the weight of the world got me leanin on a fifth \  

  still i’m out here grindin, tryna make it through the dark \  
  every scar i carry got a story, leave a mark \  
  pour the pain in my cup, let it spill, let it spark \  
  i’m my own hero, baby, you my only arc \  

  we reach the sky, leave the struggle in the past \  
  but the tec and the wok got me movin kinda fast \  
  life a marathon, but i’m sprintin with no map \  
  still i keep it real, ‘cause my heart’s where i’m at \
  chillin on yo block im crusing in a scatt \
