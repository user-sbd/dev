  == lyrics for my song

  #sub[*lemmie get that blunt rq*] \
  she said she love me im drinkin 3rd degree \
  tryna deal with the pain but all she do is flea \
  in the end bae its just you or me \

  \
  treat her like a princess in and out of fast cars \ 
  i be outside drinkin in and outa boujee bars \
  i sip on the tec my bih say au revoir \
  you the one baby girl we can make it real far \
  im like a dark night baby you my only star \
  if its with you bae ill go to mars\
  look on my wrist girl this ain jus a audemar \
  sometimes attraction sometimes like bein drawn apart \
