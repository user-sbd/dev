= Dear Managing Director,  \
I am writing to you as Nitin, a Grade 10 student at Fishtail Academy, to express my deep concerns about several ongoing issues that are adversely affecting the learning environment and well being of students, including myself. As a student who has previously attended schools in Canada, I bring a perspective informed by international educational standards, and it is disheartening to see how far our institution deviates from the "international" ethos it claims to uphold. While I appreciate the school's efforts to provide an IB World School curriculum, certain practices by the teaching staff undermine these aspirations and contradict both national laws and global best practices. I am not speaking solely from my own experiences; these sentiments are shared by the entire class, though I feel compelled to stand up now as the situation has become unbearable. This does not imply that my peers are incapable of voicing their concerns. I am simply worried about the escalating impact on everyone's mental and emotional health.  

== Unacceptable behavior by teachers

It is unfortunate that, rather than fostering a supportive atmosphere, some teachers at Fishtail Academy appear to prioritize criticism over encouragement, leading to widespread demotivation among students. For instance, I have personally witnessed teachers making remarks that bring students to the brink of tears, such as belittling their efforts in front of the class or dismissing their questions outright. This is not an isolated incident; just yesterday, during morning classes, a teacher wielded a glue stick with the clear intention of using it as an instrument of intimidation, which only served to heighten anxiety rather than promote discipline. Such actions do little to inspire learning and instead create an environment of fear.  

Research consistently demonstrates the profound benefits of positive teacher student relationships on academic performance and motivation. A study by Roorda et al. (2011) found that "warm, supportive interactions between teachers and students are associated with higher levels of student engagement and reduced dropout rates." Similarly, the American Psychological Association highlights that improving these relationships leads to long lasting improvements in both academic achievement and social development, stating that "positive teacher student relationships can lead to better teaching and increased student motivation" (American Psychological Association n.d.). In contrast, negative interactions, like those observed here, can erode self esteem and hinder educational progress. Coming from a Canadian educational background, where teachers emphasize encouragement and individualized support, I have noticed a stark change in student behavior: in environments with nicer, more empathetic educators, motivation soars, absenteeism decreases, and overall academic performance improves significantly. It is regrettable that our school, which prides itself on being an IB World School, falls short of these standards, appearing more akin to outdated local practices than a truly international institution.  

To illustrate this point, consider the following diagram depicting the correlation between teacher supportiveness and student outcomes, based on meta analytic data from various studies:

=== Physical Harassment, Violations of Rules 

Furthermore, the prevalence of physical harassment is deeply concerning and directly contravenes established rules. Despite the IB World School guidelines emphasizing safe and respectful learning environments, there has scarcely been a day when I have not observed a student being subjected to physical reprimand, such as grabbing hair or striking with objects. Yesterday morning, as mentioned, a glue stick was brandished threateningly, and on multiple occasions, teachers have grabbed students by the hair to enforce compliance. These actions not only cause physical discomfort but also emotional distress, rushing to conclusions without understanding the full context and often favoring the first speaker in any dispute.  

The Government of Nepal explicitly prohibits all forms of corporal punishment under the Act Relating to Children 2018, which states: "No child shall be subjected to corporal punishment or any other form of violence in the name of education or discipline" (Government of Nepal 2018). This law aligns with international standards, including those expected of IB World Schools, where the International Baccalaureate Organization requires schools to promote child safeguarding and prohibit harmful practices, as outlined in their rules for IB World Schools which emphasize creating a safe and caring environment (International Baccalaureate Organization 2023). A report by the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children notes that such bans are essential for transforming school culture and protecting children's rights to dignity and development, stating that "ending corporal punishment in schools is an overdue and urgent priority" (Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children 2021). It is puzzling that, in a school aspiring to international status, these fundamental protections are overlooked, leading to an atmosphere more reminiscent of punitive traditions than progressive education.  

== Opposite Gender relationships

Guys and girls can absolutely form genuine, platonic friendships built on mutual respect, shared interests, and emotional support, much like any same-gender bond, without romantic undertones overshadowing the connection. The key is to prioritize open communication, set clear boundaries from the start, and focus on common ground such as hobbies, career goals, or intellectual discussions, allowing the relationship to thrive as a source of companionship rather than expectation. However, it's crucial not to stereotype them by assuming that every cross-gender interaction must lead to romance or jealousy, as this can poison the dynamic and ruin the friendship; for instance, if friends constantly tease a guy and girl about "secret crushes" during group hangouts, it might create awkwardness and pressure, leading one or both to pull away to avoid rumors. Another example is when societal biases label a caring male friend as "just waiting for his chance" or a supportive female friend as "leading him on," which erodes trust and turns innocent gestures, like a comforting hug after a bad day, into sources of suspicion, ultimately fracturing what could have been a lifelong, enriching friendship. By rejecting these outdated stereotypes and treating each other as individuals first, such friendships can flourish, offering diverse perspectives and strengthening personal growth without unnecessary drama.

=== Unsubstantiated Policies on Hair Length 

Adding to these issues is the school's rigid enforcement of hair length policies, which bear no relation to academic success and infringe on personal autonomy. Studies have repeatedly shown no correlation between hair length and scholastic performance. For example, an experimental study by Smith (1971) assessed the effects of longer hairstyles in classrooms and found no detrimental impact on student focus or achievement, concluding that "the introduction of longer hairstyles in the classroom situation upon student's [sic] ... had no significant effects." Similarly, research indicates that penalizing students for natural or longer hair is unfounded and often rooted in bias, with no evidence linking hair length to educational outcomes (Henderson and Bourgeois 2021). In Nepal, there is no governmental mandate requiring students to cut their hair short; school dress codes are institutional preferences, not legal requirements, and the Ministry of Education does not impose such rules (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Nepal n.d.). Students should not be compelled to alter their appearance if it does not directly affect studies, as this only adds to unnecessary harassment.  

From my experience in Canadian schools, where hair policies are minimal and focused on hygiene rather than uniformity, students exhibit greater self confidence and creativity, contributing to better overall performance. The insistence on short hair here seems arbitrary and demotivating, further distancing the school from its proclaimed international identity.  

To visualize the lack of correlation, here is a scatter plot representation based on available research data:

In conclusion, these practices—demotivation, physical and emotional harassment, and unfounded policies—are not only counterproductive but also against rules and contrary to IB principles. I urge you to investigate these matters promptly, engage with students for feedback, and implement training for teachers on positive reinforcement techniques. Our class deserves an environment that truly reflects international standards, where motivation thrives and rights are respected. I am available for a meeting to discuss this further and can provide corroboration from peers if needed. In the end I'm not completely sure if you have been informed of these issues and if not I am happy to be the one to bring it forward, I'm looking forward to a big change in the upcoming days. In no point of this letter have I tried to blame you whatsoever for these actions done by the teachers as other peoples behaviors are out of your hands. I would just like to bring this issue upfront so it can be dealed with appropriately.

Thank you for your attention to this serious issue.  

Sincerely,  

Nitin  
Grade 10 Student
