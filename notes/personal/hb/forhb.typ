  = Position Paper: Republic of Türkiye
  == **Committee:** Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM)
  == **Topic:** Human Rights of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons
  == **Delegation:** Republic of Türkiye

  == **Introduction**
  The Republic of Türkiye is one of the world’s largest hosts of refugees, showing strong commitment to protecting the human rights of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). With approximately 3.2 million registered Syrian refugees and over 222,000 individuals from other nations, Türkiye addresses climate-induced displacements, gender-sensitive humanitarian policies, and the integration of international humanitarian laws. This paper outlines Türkiye’s efforts, challenges such as excessive reliance on foreign aid and privacy concerns in the AI surveillance era, and suggests improvements for enhancing human rights protection worldwide.

  == **National Policy and Commitment**
  Türkiye has built a solid legal system to protect refugees and IDPs through the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (2013) and the Temporary Protection Regulation (2014). The Presidency of Migration Management (PMM) handles registration and support, working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide aid and assist with resettlement. Addressing climate-induced displacements, Türkiye invests in resilient infrastructure. Gender-sensitive policies prioritize women and children, while efforts to bridge international humanitarian laws align national legislation with global standards, despite geographical limitations. Türkiye has spent billions over the past decade on refugee housing, healthcare, and education, promoting self-sufficiency to manage reliance on foreign aid. Initiatives also protect privacy in the AI surveillance era through data regulations.

  == **Challenges and Concerns**
  Türkiye faces major challenges in protecting refugee and IDP rights. The large number of refugees strains resources, and public opinion has grown critical due to economic issues and high inflation. Climate-induced displacements exacerbate resource pressures, while gender disparities in service access persist. Excessive reliance on foreign aid risks long-term dependency, and non-Syrian refugees, such as those from Afghanistan and Iraq, face fewer rights and long waits for resettlement. Privacy concerns arise with AI surveillance, and aligning humanitarian laws with international norms remains complex due to geopolitical constraints.

  == **Recommendations**
  1. Increase global support through funding, resettlement programs, and technical assistance to share responsibility for climate-induced displacements.
  2. Strengthen legal systems by adopting clear asylum laws based on the 1951 Refugee Convention, ensuring gender-sensitive policies and removing geographical limits for equal protection.
  3. Promote integration by creating policies that help refugees join labor markets and schools, supporting self-reliance to reduce aid dependency.
  4. Tackle root causes by resolving conflicts and supporting development in countries of origin, facilitating safe returns.
  5. Protect vulnerable groups with targeted programs for women, children, and people with disabilities, improving access to services.
  6. Safeguard privacy in the AI surveillance era with robust regulations and develop sustainable financial opportunities.

  == **Conclusion**
  The Republic of Türkiye remains dedicated to protecting the human rights of refugees and IDPs, despite significant challenges. Through its experience and partnerships with UNHCR, Türkiye calls for a global approach that focuses on shared responsibility, legal protections, and sustainable integration. Türkiye urges SOCHUM to support efforts that address displacement causes, strengthen cooperation, and ensure the dignity and rights of all displaced people.
